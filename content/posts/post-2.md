This is just a blog for me to jot notes down about things I am learning, or looking forward to learning. I am currently working in a SWE adjacent role, the long/medium term goal being to move into an SWE role. I do not currently have a degree, but am working toward one in my free time. Here are a few things I am looking to cover and learn over the next few years. This list will definitely change over time.  

## Education Goals
