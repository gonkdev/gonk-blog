This is a simple blog that I am going to use to track my progress throughout a career in tech. Currently I am in my early 30s, and working in a tech role that is adjacent to Software Engineering but not in a heavily technical capacity. My longterm goals are to work on highly technical software with a longterm focus on Computer Graphics and AI. 

## Education: 
I am currently taking classes toward a Bachelors in Computer Scince. I have spend the past decade or so taking classes intermittently at a local community college, and eventually at online colleges. I am determined to finish my Bachelors by early next year (2024), and then move onto a Masters program.
